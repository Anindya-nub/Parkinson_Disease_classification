# Parkinson's Disease Classification

This project focuses on classifying Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. The notebook provides an exploratory analysis of the data and applies predictive models to identify patterns that distinguish individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy individuals.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization and analysis of the dataset to uncover key trends and distributions.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of classification algorithms to predict Parkinson's disease.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessment of model accuracy and other metrics.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - Other dependencies (listed in the notebook)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Anindya-nub/Parkinson_Disease_classification>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd parkinson-disease-classification
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook parkinson-disease-classification.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Explore the data.
   - Train machine learning models.
   - Evaluate model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains features extracted from voice recordings. These features help differentiate between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's disease.

**Key Features:**
- Fundamental frequency of voice
- Harmonics-to-noise ratio
- Jitter, Shimmer, etc.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature scaling and normalization.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   - Visualization of feature distributions.
   - Correlation analysis.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, etc.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing Parkinson's disease patients from healthy individuals. Detailed results and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
